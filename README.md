# Cul-de-Sac Crook

## Introduction

**Cul-de-Sac Crook** is a simulation game built to model a neighborhood and the activities of its residents. Users can engage in a variety of actions, from exploring the neighborhood and tracking residents to committing robberies and evading capture. The project leverages core data structures and algorithms to provide a functional, interactive experience with features like movement monitoring, crime detection, and leaderboards.

- Tracks traversal and resident locations.

### 2. **Resident Tracking**

- Tracks residents using queues and their predefined routes.
- Logs financial statuses and recent movements.

### 3. **Movement Monitoring**

- Observes deviations from usual resident routes.
