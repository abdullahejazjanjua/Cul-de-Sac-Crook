Your game can leverage data structures like graphs, trees, stacks, and queues to efficiently implement gameplay features and mechanics. Here's a breakdown of how these can be used:

1. Graphs: Representing the Neighborhood
Use Case: Represent the neighborhood's layout, including houses, shops, parks, and roads.
Implementation:
Nodes: Represent locations (houses, shops, police stations).
Edges: Represent paths between locations (streets, alleys).
Weights (optional): Assign weights to edges to represent distance or danger levels (e.g., paths near police stations might have higher weights for criminals).

Algorithms:
Shortest Path (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm): Determine optimal routes for police patrols or player escapes.
Depth-First Search (DFS)/Breadth-First Search (BFS): Detect reachable locations, simulate resident movements, or identify high-risk zones.
Once caught Use Dijkstra's algo to escape. Add a probabilty to make the player catchable and escapable

2. Trees: Managing Resident and Crime Data
Use Case: Store user info to easy access


3. Stack: Alert System
Use Case: Store and resolve alerts for recent incidents.
Implementation:
Use a stack to maintain unresolved alerts, with the most recent alert at the top.

Alerts can include:
Resident ID: Who triggered the alert.
Location: Where it occurred.
Incident Type: Suspicious movement, robbery, etc.

Mechanics:
Push: Add a new alert when an incident is detected.
Pop: Resolve the most recent alert (e.g., when the police investigate).
Peak: View the current unresolved alert for immediate attention.

4. Queue: Resident Movement Tracking
Use Case: Monitor recent movements for each resident.
Implementation:
Use a queue to store the last N locations of each resident (e.g., a rolling history of movements).
Set N based on the length of a usual route or the time window for suspicious behavior detection.
Mechanics:
Enqueue: Add a new location when the resident moves.
Dequeue: Remove the oldest location when the queue reaches capacity.
Pattern Detection: Analyze the queue for deviations or repeated patterns.

5. Additional Applications
Crime Pattern Detection (Graphs + Queues):
Track frequent robbery locations:
Use the graph to identify clusters of high-crime nodes.
Combine with resident movement queues to detect patterns (e.g., targeting houses near the usual route).

Suspicious Behavior Analysis (Trees + Graphs):
Use a tree to track a resident's wealth changes or crime history.
Combine with graph traversal to predict potential crime zones based on proximity and past behavior.
Police Patrol Optimization (Graphs):
Use weighted graph traversal to design optimal patrol routes, focusing on high-crime zones.

Escape Routes (Graphs + Stacks):
When a robbery occurs, push possible escape routes to a stack based on proximity.
Pop routes off the stack as the player escapes, dynamically adjusting based on police movements.
Example Scenarios and Implementation

Resident Movement:
Input: The neighborhood graph, resident's usual route, and movement queue.
Logic:
Each time the resident moves, enqueue the new location.
Compare the queue to the usual route:
If the queue deviates significantly, trigger an alert (push to stack).
Crime Detection:
Input: Neighborhood graph, resident location, and action (robbery).
Logic:
Update the victim’s wealth and the thief’s wealth.
If robberies occur frequently or near specific nodes:
Push an alert to the stack.
Update crime pattern in the crime report tree.
Alert System:
Input: Alert stack.


Logic:
Push a new alert when an incident occurs.
Police AI pops alerts to resolve them, starting with the most recent.
Tech Stack Recommendations
Programming Languages: Python (for graph and data structure libraries like NetworkX), Java, or C++.
Libraries:
Graphs: NetworkX (Python) for graph creation and traversal.
Queues/Stacks: Python’s collections.deque or custom implementations.
Trees: Use libraries like binarytree in Python or implement custom BSTs.
